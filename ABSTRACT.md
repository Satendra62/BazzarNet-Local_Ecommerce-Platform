## Project Abstract: BazzarNet - Local E-commerce Platform

BazzarNet is a comprehensive, full-stack e-commerce platform designed to bridge the gap between local businesses and their customers, facilitating efficient and rapid doorstep delivery. The application addresses the growing demand for localized online shopping experiences by providing a robust digital marketplace that empowers small and medium-sized enterprises while enhancing customer convenience.

The platform features distinct user roles—Customer, Vendor, and Administrator—each equipped with tailored functionalities. Customers can browse products and stores, manage shopping carts and wishlists, proceed through a multi-step checkout process with coupon application and UPI QR payment, and track their orders in real-time. Vendors are provided with a dedicated dashboard for managing their store, products, orders, and payments, enabling them to digitize their operations and expand their reach. Administrators oversee the entire ecosystem, with capabilities for user, product, store, and order management, ensuring platform integrity and smooth operation.

Developed using a modern technology stack, the frontend leverages React with Vite, Tailwind CSS for responsive styling, and Framer Motion for dynamic UI. The backend is built with Node.js and Express, utilizing MongoDB for data persistence, JWT for secure authentication, and Joi for robust input validation. This architecture ensures a scalable, secure, and maintainable application. BazzarNet's innovative approach aims to foster local commerce, offering a seamless and secure shopping experience for users and a powerful management tool for businesses.
